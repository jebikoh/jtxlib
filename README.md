# JTXLib

**Update: June 2025**

This library has gotten pretty messy and bloated. I am planning on doing a leaner rewrite/refactor in the near future and also have better support for SIMD (SSE and NEON)

This just a compilation of classes and functions that I was using commonly between my graphics projects.

Much of this is based of [PBRTv4](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v4) and [EDXUtil](https://github.com/behindthepixels/EDXUtil)/[EDXRay](https://github.com/behindthepixels/EDXRay)

Other useful resources:
 - [PBR Book](http://www.pbr-book.org/)
 - [The Right Way to Calculate Stuff](http://www.plunk.org/~hatch/rightway.html)

Quick note on building tests: use build type "TEST" as it will enable test assertions that don't abort the program
